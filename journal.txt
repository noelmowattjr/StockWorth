	Today I added an interface to my project with 3 methods to be implemented.<br/>Also, I began introducing my user prompts, but I donâ€™t want this program to be <br />a series of too many questions for the user to answer; instead I just want to ask the<br />user 4 to 5 questions max and return results using some finance api for public companies.
